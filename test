to be honest, I really want to stay with this team. If there were a promotion opportunity here, I’d 100% choose to stay.

The thing is, my new squad is just waiting for the final offer to come through, and if I turn it down at that point, I might not get another chance. As you know, this offer didn’t follow the usual process — it took quite a lot of effort from a few people. Aaron and Ed really pushed hard for me, and I’d feel bad turning it down after all their support.

That said, I really value what we’ve built here and I’d love to keep growing with this team if there’s any possibility. I know it might not be easy, but if there’s any way to explore that option, I’d really appreciate it.
