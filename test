Hi Aaron,

I just wanted to let you know that I’ve signed the contract for the software consultant role today and have already received the confirmation email.

I really want to thank you and Ed for all your support throughout this process. Initially, I thought I had already settled in the Manhattan team, and I didn’t expect Gemma would want me to stay for the ISO project as well. As it turns out, I’ll now be splitting my time 50/50 between both teams — supporting Manhattan until their new developer joins.

This whole process was quite unexpected, and I truly hope it hasn’t caused any inconvenience to your work. Once again, thank you so much for your understanding and support. My past four years working in Digital have been an incredibly enjoyable and valuable experience.
